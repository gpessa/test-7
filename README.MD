This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Versions

### Version 1
After 2 hours, I had the first 2 tasks implemented with some tests.
For the third task the idea was to create a picture (stringify version) of the array and use it the next time to understand if the array had some change.
The function to understand if the array was changed was been wrote.

### Version 2
It took 30 minutes extra extra. 
I added typescript (I can't live without) and a small interface to test the algorithm
